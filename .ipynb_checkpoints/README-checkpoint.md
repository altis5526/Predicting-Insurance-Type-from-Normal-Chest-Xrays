# Predicting-Insurance-Type-from-Normal-Chest-Xrays
## Introduction
This is the official repository of the ML4H 2025 finding paper (under submission): "The Unawareness of AI Looking for Health Insurance Type from Normal Chest X-ray Images".

### Abstract
Due to the broad use of artificial intelligence in healthcare settings, one should be more cautious about the spurious correlation that has been learned by the model. In this study, we focused on the health insurance type feature, which is highly correlated to patients' socioeconomic status, hidden in the chest X-ray images. We demonstrated that common deep vision models are able to learn insurance type information unperceivable to humans in the subtle textures of the medical images. The result serves as a calling to re-examine the current trained chest X-ray classifiers and ensure that they treat economically different populations equally.
